# ads1256-library
2.0 Added support for 2 or more boards using class ADCcads1256, use ADCads1256 instead ads1256u, since there is a bug on Channel selection, wich after 2 years I don't remember how I fixed it, also you can try if there is not the bug at high Speed rate, I can't because I dont have the ADCs anymore.

An example was uploaded, I'll translate all library to english soon, for the moment enjoy spanish-english mixed.

1.0 Easy example for library for ads1256, tested on arduino mega and due; based on dariosalvi78 and flydroid codes.
